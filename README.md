# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map using the MapBox API and javascript to visualize earthquake data from the past week using data from United States government. The map has three layers: 'Streets', 'Sattelite', and 'Dark' which change the visual appearance of the underlying map. Furthermore the map can be adjusted to show one or more of the following criteria: 'Earthquakes', 'Major Earthquakes' and 'Tectonic Plates'. Examples of the following maps can be seen below with the different tile layers with all criteria selected:
